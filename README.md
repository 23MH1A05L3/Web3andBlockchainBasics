🪙 Blockchain DApp Interaction using MetaMask & Ethereum Test Network
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical interaction with blockchain decentralized applications (DApps) using the MetaMask wallet and the Ethereum Sepolia Test Network.
The objective is to understand how blockchain wallets, test networks, faucets, and DApps like Uniswap and OpenSea work together in a real blockchain environment.

🚀 Implementation Steps
Step 1: MetaMask Installation

Installed the MetaMask browser extension.

Created a new wallet and secured the recovery phrase.

Connected MetaMask to the browser for blockchain access.

Step 2: Crypto Wallet Creation

Created a new wallet by setting a strong password and backup seed phrase.

This wallet serves as the gateway for all blockchain transactions.

Step 3: Test Network Configuration

Switched MetaMask from “Ethereum Mainnet” to Sepolia Test Network.

Verified the test network configuration and connection status.

Step 4: Faucet Interaction

Visited a Sepolia Faucet to receive free test ETH.

Requested ETH successfully and confirmed the transaction on Etherscan.

Verified that the wallet balance was updated.

Step 5: DApp Interaction
App 1: Uniswap

Connected MetaMask to Uniswap Testnet.

Attempted a token swap simulation to understand DApp transaction flow.

Observed transaction confirmation through MetaMask and Etherscan.

App 2: OpenSea

Tried connecting to OpenSea Testnet.

Observed that OpenSea currently does not support testnet operations.

Step 6: Etherscan Transaction View

Opened the Sepolia Etherscan explorer.

Verified transaction details such as From Address, To Address, Gas Fee, and Confirmation Time.

📄 Reflection / Learning Outcome

Through this project, I gained a clear understanding of how blockchain DApps work in practice. I learned how to:

Configure MetaMask and connect to a test network.

Request test ETH using faucets.

Execute and confirm blockchain transactions.

Understand transaction parameters like From Address, To Address, Gas Fee, Gas Estimation, Submission, and Confirmation Times.
This project improved my confidence in working with decentralized systems, smart contracts, and blockchain explorers.
